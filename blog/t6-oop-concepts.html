      Classes are an important part of Ruby because they contain objects. In Ruby, objects can only belong to one class. Here's an example:
    </p>
    <pre>
      class Workouts
        def initialize(gym_days)
          @gym_days = gym_days
        end

        def weekly
          (@gym_days <= 2) ? puts "Go to the GYM!" : puts "Keep it up!"
        end
      end

      days = Workouts.new(2)
      p days.weekly == "Go to the GYM!" #=> Returns true
      days = Workouts.new(4)
      p days.weekly == "Keep it up!" #=> Returns true
    </pre>
    <p>
      The class <code>Workouts</code> gets called, a instance variable is defined, and two instance methods are called. The class itself is defined by <code>class</code> and the name <code>Workouts</code>. In Ruby, a captial letter must begin the name for a class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the class we have the user input <code>gym_days</code>, which is defined as a instance variable using the '@' symbol in <code>@gym_days</code>. Instance variables are shared throughout all objects of a class and only one of the variable exists within each class. Additionally, if an object instance changes the values of a class, the new value will change for all other objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the class gets called, there are two instance methods which are the driver test code part of the program. Instance methods executes the method that gets called upon for that instant the class is called. In the example, the driver test code calls on the class, <code>Workouts.new(2)</code> by defining it as <code>days</code>. This starts a new instance of the class. In the next line the instance method is called to print the true or false statement with <code>days.weekly</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ruby gives the option to code class variables and instance methods all being pulled together by a class. A class is merely a grouping of coded objects.
