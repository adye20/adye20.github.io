          <h3>Values</h3>
          <h4>February 7th, 2015</h4>
          <p>
            Why do values matter? Values represent guidelines that we follow to live by. This is extremely important because I believe that our personality and motives are a direct reflection of our values.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ambition, enthusiasm, and commitment are some of the values I think of when remembering the happiest and proudest times in my life. In general, I try to live up to these values as much as I can because it drives my happiness and personal growth.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ambitions are what allows me to achieve goals that I never thought were possible. To overcome obstacles when the odds were never in my favor. Being ambitious leads to happiness and success in life, giving me the motivation to accomplish anything that I set my mind to.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have found that the values I hold directly relate to the advice I give to my friends and family. I believe that speaks volumes of how much my values mean to me. These values have a huge impact on how I deal with the stress and pressure that builds up inside of me. My biggest threat is myself. The fear of failing to succeed keeps circling around in my head and it is impossible to shake off. However, holding true to my ambitious attitude can give me the motivation to power through any obstacle and be triumphant.
