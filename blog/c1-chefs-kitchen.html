      I first heard of DBC from a friend who was taking a rival immersive computer programming program. He graduated with a bachelor’s degree in bioengineering and even thought he took a few computer programming classes as an undergraduate, it didn’t really spark his interest so hearing that he took a jump into computer programming was very surprising to hear. He told me it was refreshing and very different than your typical structured learning curriculum. In the sense that it was more of a big group hands on learning experience that immensely reinvigorated his passion about computer programming. I felt a connection to his story because I too didn’t feel that desire to pursue computer programming when taken a couple classes as an undergraduate, except I got my bachelors as an electrical engineer, specializing in hardware. After that chat and over the next month, I researched and was continuously on Codeacademy with what free time I had away from my full time job. I always had the passion to create web designs and applications, which in the end finally pushed me to take a leap of faith and apply for DBC. What hooked me were the culture and the hand on learning. Also not to mention that their phase 0 program fits to my schedule of keeping my full time job for a while and pursue computer programming.

      It was enlightening watching Shereef talk about Kitchen vs. Table because I fall into the consumer mindset all of the time. Most of the time I take for granted and set expectations when in reality I really need to take charge. Even thought my initial feeling about DBC was more in a “kitchen” or creative mindset, Shereef encouraged and backed that feeling even more so. I believe there is huge benefit in applying the kitchen versus table concept to many other things beside just DBC.

      Although my expectations haven’t changed since watching Shereef’s Fireside Chat, it got my heart racing. Even thought I’m incredibly nervous, I’m also more excited than ever to learn with and from people who are just as dedicated as me to follow their passion. In addition, I’m excited for what I have to bring to the table too. I believe the best environment to learn is an environment where you can give back as much as you take in. In other words you learn the best by teaching what was taught to you, to your peers.

      We are all cooks with a creative mindset and we all are going to take charge of our rite of passage.
