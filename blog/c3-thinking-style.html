      When I took the personal thinking style style, I was resulted with a stong combination of concrete and abstract sequential styles of thinking. I believed that it followed my strengths and weaknesses exactly. It laid out the positives and negatives which pinpointed what I needed to work on and allowed me to focus on improving qualities. Having taken full advantage of knowing my areas of improvement allowed me to learn with an open mind and a greater understanding of each concept. <!-- added 10px padding -->

      The biggest struggle for me has been CSS design and positioning. I believe that it related to the concrete sequential style of thinking. Stuggles with following incomplete or unclear directions can be related to CSS because of open interpretation. There are simply no directions for designing in CSS. One strategy that helped me was peer pairing more often. It allowed me learn their interpretation and gave me a better understanding of how to make CSS do what I want it to do.

      DBC's teaching of a growth vs a fixed mindest helped me become more well-rounded by forcing me to learn outside of an evironment that is most comfortable for me. I will continue the push to become more well rounded by forcing myself to work on the thinking style weakness. I've found it to be a quicker and easier way to learn.
