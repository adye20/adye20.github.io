          <h3>Questions</h3>
          <h4>February 18th, 2015</h4>
          <p>
            For DBC’s cultural blog assignment this week, we are to research about asking good questions and assess how we ask questions. I was never really good at asking quality questions or at least the right questions to get the answers I was looking for.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is extremely important to ask questions when tackling a topic that is unfamiliar. In my case, that topic is learning how to code. Asking quality questions is important especially since the first 9 weeks of DBC is remote learning. This means that questions posted on StackOverflow or on the Google+ community needs to explain the problem well while not being too descriptive and wordy. Over the past 9 weeks, I have slowly found that it’s not the fact I’m horrible at asking questions but rather the question quality and how I form the question. I have learned that coding questions are best understood by being detailed in explaining the problem, the goal, and providing examples.
          </p>
          <p>
            Introducing the problem clearly and explaining my personal encounter in detail increases the likelihood of getting a quick and helpful answer. It is important to summarize the introduction of the question and follow up with a more detailed description with the goal clearly stated. It is also important to include a snippet of sample code to allow others to reproduce the problem. Keeping the sample code short will cut down time it takes someone to review and find the problem that may be within the code.  By following these guidelines I was able to get better responses in both quality and quantity.
          </p>
          <p>
            My findings from asking coding questions just didn’t stop there.  I researched a bit more to further improve my questions asking in general, not just for coding. There are two more guidelines for which I now use to ask quality questions. They are not asking yes or no questions and digging deeper. Asking yes or no questions limits the amount of information you may get because the question isn’t open ended. When asking open-ended questions, it’s requesting for more insight and possibly information that you didn’t know existed or needed.  Digging deeper is also important in obtaining more information. Follow up questions will generate engagement, discussion, and feedback that can put you on the path of being the most informative and create a great understanding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Asking questions has always been an important part of learning but the quality of questions can make the difference in getting quality responses and generating discussion to be more informed.
