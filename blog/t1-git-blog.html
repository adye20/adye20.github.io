      What are the benefits of version control?
    </p>
    <p>
      Version control has many benefits such as managing the control of files being passed from one person to another, maintaining a detailed historical log, and file recovery. Now you may be asking yourself, what benefit is it to me if I’m careful with controlling my files? From personal experience, it provides huge benefit especially from uncontrollable accidents. I was working on a cross-functional engineering team budget for satellite mass, power, and thermal margins, and as an electrical engineer I am responsible for the power budget. The thermal engineer and I were collaborating on his computer and made all the appropriate calculations for the proposed design. As we finished up our budget, I got called into another proposal meeting and left him to complete the budget.Two hours later, the thermal engineer called me to tell me that there was some last minute design changes which him and the mechanical engineer, who was in charge of the mass properties, were working on to close. Normally this wouldn’t be a problem as last minute designs come in all the time except I didn’t save a version of the budget on my computer. Big mistake! They were now deep into working to the updated design that made most of the power calculations invalid and I had no way to revert back to see what was changed and what was added. This resulted in a complete dissection of their budget just to find out what changed so I can make the correct adjustments. Needless to say that it taught us to have better version control. Being careful isn’t always a surefire way to cover mistakes and by utilizing version control it can prevent any accident that may turn into a catastrophe.

      How does git help you keep track of changes?
    </p>
    <p>
      Git helps keep track of changes by allowing you to work on and save files from the local drive on your computer without affecting the master file. By creating different branches, you can work on different versions or copies of the same file. Imagine you are about to start cooking sweet potatoes for a potluck and have multiple recipes of how to cook them but don’t know which recipe is the best. You only have six sweet potatoes to use and many recipes to choose from. But by using the branch concept you can cook to each recipe and taste test which is best and decide you only want to keep the dish that you want without wasting countless sweet potatoes in the process. This is how git keeps track of changes. You get to work in as many files as you want until you are happy with a particular file and may discard the rest.

      Why use GitHub to store your code?
    </p>
    <p>
      Github is a remote service that allows you to upload files that may only exist locally on your computer. In a way it is a flash drive that you could access all of your files from any computer without having the inconvenience of carrying around the flash drive wherever you go. This way you can always keep a backup just incase your computer or flash drive gets stolen or damaged. In addition, anytime you make a change you must comment on what kind of change was made and/or why you did it. This is like keeping a diary of your work for yourself or anyone else who maybe following your work. This leads to another very important reason to use Github. It is a social network for your work. Github allows you to remotely collaborate with other people. Now going back to my personal experience of why version control is beneficial. Github would have been perfect for that very project. By using Github, we could have effectively collaborated on the budget and easily track changes to save the time and effort of back tracking. Github helps in many ways but there is no better reason to use it as it provides piece of mind knowing that your work is safe and stored remotely in case of any disaster that may occur.
