      What is the map method? The map method is a method provide by the enumerable module. The map method inputs an enumerator and returns a new array with results calculated by the block.<!-- added 10px padding -->
    </p>
    <pre>
      map {|object| block} => array
    </pre>
    <p>
      How is #map used? #map is used to return a new calculated array without mutating the original array. This is not to be confused with #each which returns the array that calls it when a block is created.
    </p>
    <pre>
      >> teams = ['patriots', 'colts' 'seahawks', 'packers']

      >> teams.map {|team| teams.capitalize}
      => ["Patriots", "Colts", "Seahawks", "Packers"]
      # returns an array with capitalized strings

      >> team.each {|team| puts + ' are going to the conference championships'}
      => Patriots are going to the conference championships
      => Colts are going to the conference championships
      => Seahawks are going to the conference championships
      => Packers are going to the conference championships
      # simply outputs each element in the array with added string
    </pre>
    <p>
      Note that calling the array 'teams' returns the original value and with no strings of the array capitalized. Now that we know how to #map is used, lets take a look a some examples.
    </p>
    <pre>
      >> array = [6,7,8]
      >> array.map {|x| x*x}
      => [36, 49, 64]

      >> cities = ['chicago', 'miami', 'honolulu']
      >> cities.map(&:capitalize.sort)
      => ['Chicago', 'Miami', 'Honolulu']
    </pre>
    <p>
      You might have noticed something new in the block created. '&' and ':capitalize' is a short hand way of saying capitalize each element of the array.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you can imagine, #map is incredibly useful in transforming data and is one of the most commonly used methods in Ruby.
