      What are Ruby Hashes? Ruby hashes are collections of key-value pairs. This is helpful when you need to map one value to another. You might want to map a set of items to information about the items. Here’s an example:
    </p>
    <pre>
      car = {
        “name” => “Porsche”,
        “year” = > 1999,
        “color” => “black”
        }
    </pre>
    <p>
      There are many ways to create a hash.
    </p>
    <pre>
      car = Hash.new
      car[“name”] = “Porsche”
    </pre>
    <p>
      You may access each named key.
    </p>
    <pre>
      car[:name]    #=> ‘Porche’
    </pre>
    <p>
      What are JavaScript Objects? JavaScript objects are similar to Ruby hashes such that they both are collections of pairs. In JavaScript, they are known as a collection of properties that have names and values. Here’s an example:
    </p>
    <pre>
      var car = {
      name: “Porsche”,
        year: 1999,
      color: “black”
      };
    </pre>
    <p>
      You may access object properties in two ways:
    </p>
    <pre>
      car.name;   //=> ‘Porsche’
    </pre>
    <p>
      or
    </p>
    <pre>
      car[name];  //=> ‘Porsche’
    </pre>
