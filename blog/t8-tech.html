            What is Rails? Rails is a framework for building websites that is written in the Ruby language. Rails is designed to make developing web applications easier. Rails allows the developer to code less while accomplishing more than most languages and frameworks. It does this by making assumptions that there is an absolute best way to do things for increased productivity.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two major guidelines in the Rails philosophy. They are, “Don’t Repeat Yourself ” or DRY, and “Convention Over Configuration” or CoC. DRY means exactly what it says. Code is more maintainable, more extensible, and not as buggy if the developer doesn’t have to repeat the same code or information over and over again. Convention over configuration means that Rails has a belief that in web applications, there is an absolute best way to do many things and defaults to these protocols.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rails combines the Ruby language with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create web applications that runs on web servers. Rails is considered back end or server-side. Rails is more like a project of a huge community that makes software libraries to make building complex websites more simple.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rails is used by many companies from start-ups to large enterprises. Web start-ups like using rails because of the informal community of open source libraries, as know as RubyGems or “gems”, all making it possible to engineer complex web applications quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rails is beneficial in that developers can easily unravel and understand quickly as opposed to complex code that required a deep understanding of conventions. This leads to easy collaboration, quick development, and a huge community that allows for open source libraries, which build and perfect the framework that is Rails.
