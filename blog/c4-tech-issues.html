      One of the biggest and most current problems facing the tech industry is security.  Security has become ever increasingly important as it affects almost everything in our daily lives. IT systems, individual victims of cybercrimes, and advanced technological developments are just some of the areas with continual security concerns.

      IT systems are subject to security concerns all the time, as companies are no longer just overseeing the IT workspace. Instead IT systems of current day oversee the infrastructure of the whole company and products available to all parties that use their systems. Home Depot has been in hot water as of late for security breaches, which cyber thieves stole up to 60 million credit card numbers. This is a great example of what many companies are facing with having inadequate coverage invested into IT security systems to protects its customers information. Bolstering a good line of defense is the best way to prevent security breaches and something that is recommended for all companies.  Unfortunately, this is not a main focal point for many companies in the tech industry.

      Cybercrimes to individuals are most common security breaches, however, it is also the most unsolved as many victims aren’t aware that they have been involved of a computer crime.  Viruses, unpatched software, and phishing attacks are just some of the examples of cybercrimes. A good example of a phishing attack is email spam. Some emails can be replicas of legitimate emails where everything about the email looks great but once opened and lured into clicking on a link that asks for confidential information. A good way to prevent such attacks from happening are educating the user, making them aware of such attacks. In addition, better anti-phishing tools from anti-virus software companies can help in preventing one of the most common cybercrimes.

      In the tech industry everything is always advancing. Whether it is software, hardware, web or mobile apps, there will always be advanced technological developments.  Everyone wants to stay up to date with technology, but very few new tech developments involve a very high level of security. This is mainly because companies are concerned with establishing themselves as the first ones to grant access to their tech developments that little attention is spent on making it safe for its users. New technology and security should go hand in hand, however this practice isn’t as common as anyone is known to think thus resulting in many security breaches.
