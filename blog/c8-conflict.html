          <h3>Conflict</h3>
          <h4>February 11th, 2015</h4>
          <p>
            Conflicts in life are inevitable, no matter how large or small they are, everyone runs into conflicts. However, it is how you deal and sort out conflicts that help to find resolution and learn from them.
          </p>
          <p>
            I live in a townhome with four roommates not including myself. We have a two-car garage and all five of us each have a car for commuting to our separate jobs. When we first moved in together, we vowed to take turns parking in the garage. Each of us never parked in the garage more than two nights in a row. This lasted no more than two months as some of us were parking in the garage the whole week. One day I decided to step up and express my feelings except I did this in a completely wrong way. I was determined to get my fair share of the garage and drunk with rage. I spoke with each of my roommates and instead of communicating the problem and the solution. I made accusations and spoke in an angry tone.  To much of my roommates’ dislike, they were happy with me and felt attacked.
          </p>
          <p>
            After realizing that the source of the conflict was my communication and tone of voice, I felt sorry and really bad that I was reacting with my emotions. Addressing how I was feeling by attacking my roommates and reacting based on my emotions was not the way to solve the problem at hand. Instead, I just created more conflict.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to resolve the conflict I had started and the one I wanted to resolve, I quickly apologized to each of my roommates for my actions and clearly explained what I was feeling and why I was feeling it.  I had expressed that the root of my emotions was coming from the anger of coming home and not getting to park in the garage. A solution was proposed to share the parking spaces week by week, which has been going well so far.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I were to go back and relive the scenario, I would have not attacked and accused my roommates for the anger I was feeling. If there is anything that I’ve learned, it is that I should no react based on my emotions, but rather take a deep breath and a step back to clearly think of a solution to the conflict without creating more conflict.
