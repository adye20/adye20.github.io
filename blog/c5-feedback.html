          <h3>Pairing & Feedback</h3>
          <h4>January 25th, 2015</h4>
          <p>
            Pair is an essential part of coding that should be practiced more often, especially of those trying to learn and improve their skill. Pairing with other to solve the weekly challenges have provided different view of how to diesect a problem or how to even go about coding the solution. It truely allows the growth mindset to florish and expand the different possibilities of solving a challenge. Its really rewarding figuring out a solution by bouncing ideas off you pair. Especially, when sharing knowledge of coding to others because you learn more. Being calmed, patient, and focused are good things to remember while pairing. Sometimes it can be frustrating and difficult to hold these qualities but taking a break really helps to stay fresh.

            The feedback I have been giving is very positive and up lifting. There are some  constructive criticism point which I am constantly trying to work on. The feedback has been very good at improving the way I interact with others. I am often not the most patient one or good at expressing what is on my mind, but it's becoming easier and easier with each pair. I find that the most difficult thing for me to do is trying to pick something constructive to criticize them about. Even though I know it's constructive, I find it hard because I don't like pointing out flaws. The feedback portion has truly been beneficial as it sometimes feels pretty lonely trying to learn coding remotely.

            Using pairing and feedback as a guide for learning has been very impactful in the most positive way. Learning remotely can be difficult because there is no gauge of what you are learning. By using pairing and feedback opens the door of open community learning, especially since many of us have the same questions and face similar problems. I must say that I wasn't big on the idea of doing the feedback portion but it really expands out our growth mindset.
