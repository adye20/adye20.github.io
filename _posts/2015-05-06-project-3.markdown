description: Cross-Check allows the users to look up the nearest ice hockey rink in Northern California and provides a list of hockey coaches for that particular hockey rink. Additionally, coaches can create a profile and add their experience and contact info for hockey players who are looking to start playing ice hockey or refine their skills. Cross-Check was engineered in Ruby with Sinatra, and using the Google Maps API.
